## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
##  what is two to the power of five
2^5

stock.prices <- c(23,27,23,21,34)
stock.prices

names(stock.prices) <- c('Mon','Tues','Wed','Thu','Fri')
stock.prices

mean(stock.prices)

over.23 <- stock.prices>23

stock.prices[over.23]

max(stock.prices)

max.price <- stock.prices == max(stock.prices)
max.price

stock.prices[max.price]


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

```
